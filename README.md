[Sira](https://sira.riccox.com) is an open source, highly customized and accessible design system, which currently
provides TailwindCSS component class name library.

Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of websites and apps,
while providing a consistent and inclusive user experience to our end users.
In addition, the design system and component library should be easy to use for developers and designers.
